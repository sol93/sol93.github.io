When Vanessa Fondeur, founder of Latino World Travelers (no pun intended), and I first spoke at the beginning of our 6-week partnership, she wanted personas. She wanted to know her users better as she was rebuilding her site.

I was certainly able to help. I love UX research, particularly when it comes to learning the many unique quirks among individuals in their reaction to products. I have my own, too.

#### Establishing strategy and scope üöÄ

After a lengthy call together that got into the important why and how of her business, the strategy and scope, I realized I could provide her with more than a couple neat personas.

#### My goal was to provide valuable structure üì∂

Travel companies are built upon experiences. AirBnB has its own experiences division. The premise is entirely encapsulated by UX.

This was a relatively short, 6-week partnership, but all the same I wanted to leave Vanessa with some sound foundational UX principles and tools that will aid her as she scales her own TrX* business. *travel experiences

I deeply considered Latino World Traveler‚Äôs mission, to establish Latino representation in the travel industry, and to familiarize customers of all backgrounds with foreign experiences. Getting people to traverse outside of their cultural bubble, so to speak. Try something new. Have a unique, boutique experience as one traveler put it during a user interview.

We started ideating during that call, or what I call idea-building, uncovering opportunities to build upon her brand identity, and to capture her market share of the travel space.

#### Dream. Discover. Inspire. üåü

The tagline for Latino World Travelers.

But, it could be more. One of my first recommendations was to bake the tagline into her information architecture of the website. Each word represents an actionable branch of her products and services.

1. Allow users to dream of new trip experiences, whether on a group trip led by Vanessa herself, or by themselves on a private trip planned through Latino World Travelers.
2. Help users discover invaluable travel advice, consume content related to other people‚Äôs travel experiences, or interact with the community on the Facebook group, or other social media.
3. And, to inspire other Latinos to do the same by joining the World Traveler ambassador program, encouraging inclusion and community.

Community is at the heart of Latino World Travelers. I happened upon Comradery, a great webapp integration that empowers businesses to build a communities on their websites. I strongly recommended it.

I believe in empowering businesses with SaaS apps whenever possible. Some subscriptions are well with your time. You don‚Äôt have to reinvent the wheel if you can find the right spokes. Just get it moving.

Another of my immediate ideas was an effort to better illuminate the uniquely diverse nature of the Latino identity through travel experiences:

* Using Vanessa‚Äôs education background as a basis, I thought why not create a trip as part of an educational trip package for those wishing to investigate and experience the roots of their ethic identity.

Travelers could receive a genealogy test as a part of the trip package, and visit a country that represents a portion of their ethnicity they may be interested in. That could encompass Central and South America, Africa, and Europe. Vanessa already had an interest in working with schools, taking students on lovely adventures. This would build upon that model.

#### The deliverables

The rest of my time spent with Latino World Travelers culminated in the following UX deliverables that I hope will be valuable resources for the business moving forward.

#### User Interviews

An affinity map concluding my research findings. The categories were broken down into experience, booking, expectations, activities, trip energy level, transportation, and community.

#### Competitor tracking

Latina World Travelers is another welcome addition to the people of color travel space.

#### User flows ‚è¨

In our strategy call, we devised the two most important red routes for her site: group trip booking and private trip booking, illuminated here.

Group trips with Latino World Travelers build bonds. Find out for yourself.

Looking for something more personal? Make a custom trip itinerary.

#### Information architecture üèõ

AKA sitemap.

This project only entailed the red routes during the redesign. I included the rest for reference to her so she may build out the pages within the map to help her with structural inventory.

#### Actionable research, testing a red route

During our strategy call, Vanessa mentioned her immense interest in building a custom-booking platform for her website. I wanted to help her actualize the idea through a clickable prototype.

It would be a basic route, tested with users I previously interviewed. For now, users are able to only book trip activities through Latino World Travelers. Integrating flight and accommodation booking is for a later iteration.

#### Sketchwork

Initially, I thought a drag and drop calendar would be awesome. Let users select as many activities as they are interested in and then they can fit them together into possible itineraries.

Shows the progression of moving from one location to another.

The design didn‚Äôt quite hit the mark. It was workable, but not an ideal prototype. And it would be difficult to transition to mobile. Not that many users would book a trip on their phone, but some do.

I wanted to keep the scheduling feel as an experience. I made it similarly to any table we may create in a spreadsheet. Simple, but effective.

I like options. So I thought, why not lay out the feature as a schedule already, and display events happening in all available locations at the same time so that users can peruse, and pick and choose.

Then I got to designing. I did everything in Figma. Latino World Traveler‚Äôs lent me their color initial design for the front page, along with their color palette. For fonts, I chose Monsterrat & Nunito . Very fun and bouncy.

A few key screens from the prototype

#### Key user-test findings

* Multiple users asked about flight and hotel accommodations
* A user wanted to know how physically strenuous an activity would be
* Users wanted to plan for just one location at a time. This would scale well to mobile as well.
* Users wanted clearer CTA‚Äôs when selecting how many guests would be attending a trip, and for selecting travel dates. At the moment users must select the number of guests, hit confirm, then select their dates and hit confirm. The current design seemed clunky to them.
* There was some confusion that occurred when users clicked a city they were interested in under ‚ÄòPlaces to go.‚Äô A few users assumed the planner would open immediately for them. They wondered why all of the cities were displayed during the planning option.
* Users loved being able to share the completed itinerary with friends, and to save it to Google calendar.
* I was missing a period after one of the headlines.
* Users wanted to select the number of days they were staying in a location earlier in the route.

#### Going forward

* Provide flight and hotel accommodation options.
* Provide a way to measure the energy level of an activity.
* Provide travel times between locations.
* Provide an interactive map. This just isn‚Äôt possible in a prototype.
* Make the planning feature more social, allowing users to invite people to look at and comment on the itinerary.
* Make an option to plan location by location.
* Define what activities by type. Add activity categories.

I had hoped to instill a bit of the ruggedness that UX offers into Latino World Travelers, so that in the future the company may continue to iterate its products and services using UX as a guiding practice.
