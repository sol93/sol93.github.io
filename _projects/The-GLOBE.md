This case study is related to mobile news consumption and information gate keeping, a problem space I‚Äôm deeply passionate about. Everything contained here were deliverables for my UX capstone project at Springboard. It‚Äôs the beginning of an ongoing body of work.

I was a solo designer throughout this journey, though none of this would have been possible without the support of family, friends, and mentors: Luca Longo, John Maier, James Pikover, Noam Segal, and Joel Barr. And, shout out to my career coach Calvin Nisbet. The Springboard team has been great.

My chief loves of UX are research, product strategy and product management, however, you will see me try my hand at every leg of the design journey: from conducting secondary research and qualitative interviews to moderating users tests with a functioning prototype, validating the most basic red routes of the concept.

Now, without further ado, here is my foray into mobile news consumption.

![](/images/pagebreak.jpg)

I guess I should thank President Trump for alerting me to the danger of 'fake news.' Without him, I may never have turned my designer‚Äôs eye to news consumption.

#### The year was 2016

I was studying journalism & media studies at Rutgers University.

I took a class called media management taught by a Bruce Reynolds, a startlingly refreshing character and a seasoned veteran of print news. He was a gruff man that grew up poor in Newark, and he was a talker. He loved to tell stories of his youth. He always talked about how times have changed. Indeed, they have.

In that class, for a group project two classmates and I came up with the humble beginnings of what would become this case study‚Äôs concept: a news aggregator that was able to report just the facts about topics and events free from speculative reporting.

It was a good idea the more I thought of it, and something I slowly became obsessed with. In my head, it seemed to work.

But, that‚Äôs not the UX approach.

See, I wanted to develop the idea. But, I‚Äôm just a writer. I didn‚Äôt even know about UX at the time. I was still in school studying journalism. It felt like a tough nut to crack on my own.

All the while, Trump was touting about fake news while real disinformation ravaged the 2016 election. People were steaming, and the relationship between the news and the people was dicey.

#### From journalism to UX

After graduating from Rutgers, I shelved the idea. That was, until I felt certain about my transition to UX. It was a choice well made.

Fast forward to October 2019 when I started Springboard, and now the summer of 2020, and the incredulous thing about all of this is that the core assumptions I made about the idea‚Äôs UX in 2016 have held sound to this point ‚Äî hope I didn‚Äôt jinx it.


#### Product research

What has changed was that like many others back in 2016, I thought fact-checking was the cure. It would re-establish the news credibility. Fake news had to be rooted out and discredited wherever possible.

The assumption was unfounded rather early.

An excerpt from the Poynter institute remarking on Dartmouth‚Äôs study about how fake news affected the 2016 election.

It may as come as a surprise, but it shouldn't be given what UX‚Äôers already understand about users. The fact is that users won‚Äôt delegate another step to their news consumption system unless they really have to. We depend on the news to be true, and not misleading. We‚Äôd rather take you at your word.

Lucky for me, tons of fresh research on news consumption habits has been undertaken since 2016, and the real issues harming users‚Äô ability to consume quality news information are more related to UX than anything else.

#### Problem #1: The news is difficult to manage

![](/images/Problem#1.png)
This data is rather self-explanatory. What is important to understand is the emotional exhaustion that accompanies digging through news information to stay informed.

#### Problem #2: It‚Äôs difficult for users to decipher fact from opinion

This may seem directly related to fact checking, but there is an important distinction here: a person‚Äôs belief that an opinion is true does not make it a fact. And yet, there is so much speculative reporting these days that many of us are taking someone‚Äôs opinion at face value and calling it a factual truth.

It‚Äôs simply not the case. Opinions =/= facts. Opinions are meant to persuade, while facts are meant to prove.

![](/images/Problem#2.png)
It seems you don‚Äôt have to be a news geek to be good at deciphering fact from opinion.

Interesting to note is that digital savviness was as big a factor as any other criteria. In fact, those not digitally savvy deciphered the fewest percentage of statements correctly as either fact or opinion.

It‚Äôs a bit alarming. Though, this is something that a better UX can definitely assuage.


#### Problem #3: News gathering on social media is difficult and often unreliable.

![](/images/Problem#3.png)
Depending on the platform, users can get only a snippet of a snippet as a synopsis of a news story. And, while Twitter is becoming more legitimate news platform, even there you are limited to 280 character posts. The condensed experience coupled with the issues illustrated in the graphic make it a subpar feed for actual news.

The news is another victim of and convert to the content cult.

Aside from the more dangerous culprits that haunt social media news such as disinformation and news censorship is a phenomenon called the news echo chamber, when users are further cemented in their bias because the sources they go to most often produce speculation grounded in similar opinions.

Echo chambers are difficult to get out of until you consciously understand that you‚Äôre in one.

#### Problem #3: a habit of news snacking

News snacking is a particularly interesting term that has surfaced to prominence with the advent of digital news, particularly regarding content on mobile devices.


A study conducted by Logan Molyneaux of Temple University says:

> ‚ÄúMobile technology has the potential to exacerbate the trend toward snacking on news to the extent that it encourages shorter, dispersed consumption patterns and to the extent that mobile news use displaces other forms of news consumption.‚Äù

Snacking can be associated with many other user behaviors on mobile devices. We are encouraged to check our phones multiple times a day for a variety of reasons, and normally the interactions are short.

![](/images/snacking.png)
The study cited that ‚Äúchecking‚Äù is a major habit on mobile devices, and that two thirds of users use their phones to keep up with the news.

The important thing to note here is that the average amount of time that users spend per session checking the news on their mobile phones was 12-minutes or less. This behavior could be done multiple times a day, but its interspersed nature means that the checking is done more serendipitously to fill in gaps of free time.

Also, a correlation can be made here that digital news content is not designed to fit the reduced screen time that users get with the content.

How many articles can you read in 12 minutes? How many videos can you watch? We only have so much time in the day, and without the routine of the morning paper, it can be difficult to find time for the news.

#### Qualitative research: user interviews

There‚Äôs no shortage of existing research devoted to news gathering habits, but you can‚Äôt always design by the numbers. You need a user in mind.

I sat down with seven users: Eunice Pereyra and Richard Ludescher who were both interviewed in person with audio recorded, while Donald Schaffner, Leslie White, Jeremy Medford, Jay Santoro, and Jessica Paolini were all interviewed over Skype with the sessions recorded.

Interviews with these users further corroborated secondary research findings. Quotes and other findings were aggregated into an affinity map to extract insights from.

![](/images/GLOBE-affinity-map.png)
Map key: Purple = category / Yellow = research finding / Green = user quote / Red = pain point / Blue = insight gained


#### Keywords from user interviews üó£

> ‚ÄúHistory shapes current events, we live in an increasingly fractured world, not optimal, selective hearing, cross reference, dashboard, transparency, frenzied news cycle, 5 why‚Äôs, more sources, balance, distracted, multiple check-ins, backstory, repetitive news cycle, lack of foundation and understanding, reputable, familiar, various sources, rush to judgment, information overload***, echo chamber, local news is important, bias is unfair, enjoys long-form pieces, face value, can be intense, complicated, find the simplest and easiest way to tell a story, objective, replace copy when possible, condensed version, headlines can be enough vs. headlines are not enough, keep track of events, topics go under the radar, updates on legislation, polarized, convenience, small chunks, integrated, news inflicted on me, civic responsibility, comprehensive, deliberate, minute by minute, leaning left or right, no-one-size-fits-all, not tech-savvy, local news builds communities, firehose of articles, ignite, numb, exhausted.‚Äù

#### Persona(s)

With this, there was enough user data to construct a set of personas.

Here is a middle-ground user, one that straddles the generation gap between millennials and baby boomers.

Meet Sally, the super mom, who does her best to balance her responsibilities as a senior business professional and a loving mom.

![](/images/persona.png)
Sally is the type to follow local news more closely than others. Local news is an area to keep in mind in future releases. It doesn‚Äôt appear to be viable for the current iteration.

#### Framing the problem

With knowledge of the problem space and the users that dwell in it, there was enough information to properly frame the design problem at hand:

> Users spend about 12-minutes per session checking the news on their mobile devices, and that the existing news climate does little to help users manage the system, so how a mobile UX be created that values both convenience and credibility?

In addition, I kept these questions in mind:

![](/images/how-might-i.png)
Note to reader: It must be made apparent that to create a manageable scope for this concept, answers to question 2 and 3 were omitted from my the design so that I could focus on the core functionality.

#### The solution üí°

Meet the GLOBE, an acronym for the Gathered Library of Bi-partisan Events, a chronological current events database that aggregates and consolidates the news into its topics and events. Reports on the GLOBE consist of two parts: a condensed summary report and an intensive reporting timeline. All facts are cited with sources provided. And, all reports are by default chronological. It‚Äôs effectively a real live news feed.

The idea behind the GLOBE is to give users the important and factual ‚Äòwho, what, when, and where‚Äô regarding news topics and events, free from influential speculation, and let them get to the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô on their own.

I believe it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs right to form their own opinion on current events.

![](/images/GLOBE-video.mp4)
This is me trying my hand at prototyping the most important red routes of the prototype. My UI design could use some work, but I am well prepared to polish this skill as I continue designing.

The GLOBE‚Äôs focus is to become an accessible information gatekeeper for anyone wishing to manage the news better. For now, the GLOBE is at a prototype stage where it curates only factual news reports on topics and events.

It will not curate feature articles, opeds, or other speculative reporting. There are plans to institute that curation at a later stage, in a separate feature.

#### Get to know The Globe üåê

The GLOBE is based upon aggregation, a tried and true 21st century news gathering method. There are a few great news aggregators out there, all that curate a lot of quality content for users.

My solution stands on their shoulders

![](/images/competitor-tracking.png)
My competitive tracking table of other major players in the problem space.

Yet, these solutions still suffer from symptoms of the content cult. Their algorithms appear to favor popularity over chronology, and their curation capabilities are also limited to specific stories that we hope will properly inform us in all aspects.

Yet, users can only benefit from more sources reporting on a topic or event, so long as the sources are trustworthy, provide relevant information, and are easily digestible.

#### The core feature-set

With the help of aggregation, instead of focusing on disseminating specific stories, the theory is to add more depth to reporting by condensing it for the user‚Äôs benefit. In a sense, taking the story out of the news. At least the one written by a reporter. Reading original stories will be possible, however, optional.

What is left are the four 'W's and the user can contemplate the last 'W' themselves.

The reporting timeline is an added benefit to news seeking UX, one that users will find useful to track topics and events from their beginnings to their conclusions. The GLOBE is a current events database, giving the news a memory bank.

All reports are categorized into news sections. While, some topics and events overlapping into multiple news sections, users can filter reports contained in news sections by keyword.

#### Job stories

I‚Äôm a big fan of Alan Klement‚Äôs take on customer jobs principles and his book When Coffee and Kale Compete. Users all have jobs to be done in their lives. Alan surmises that users don‚Äôt buy products for what they are, but for the specific job that it does.

Jobs to be done can be contextual in basis, but the idea behind them is to understand situations that will help users attain progress in their lives. Solutions for jobs to be done provide value beyond the function of the product.

Here is my hand at writing some initial job stories.

![](/images/job-stories.png)
Job stories made to craft feature-sets. The format goes ‚ÄúWhen____, I want to ____, so I can ____.‚Äù

#### Information architecture üèõ

Here are the hills and valleys that hold the rivers of information that stretch the GLOBE.

![](/images/sitemap.jpeg)
Sitemap for The Globe ‚Äî ‚ÄúAdd a news section,‚Äù and ‚ÄúExtended summary‚Äù were cut off in the export.

The vision here is to construct a design that allows users to get from the top level of their news feed down to specific topics and events, and back again, rather seamlessly.

The GLOBE encourages self-curation. The GLOBE will recommend news sections to users, but self-curation allows users to create their own news sections according to what they specify. If the database has enough reports to substantiate a news section, it will populate it with any past and present news related to the query. Users can rearrange the order of news sections, or delete them as they wish.

Follow-up is the user‚Äôs library of saved items.

Also, through an extensive search function, one that users can enjoy quality sourcing for queries they want a quick answer to.

#### Ye ol‚Äô block of stone ‚õ∞

It took a culmination of experiences to chip away at the design, the block of stone, to reveal a simple and functional structure.

The first few sketches were well intended, but the execution couldn‚Äôt capture the scope of its usability.

![](/images/first-sketch.png)
The rough, rough, rough draft.

The idea was to mirror some conventions that everyone is used to: Chrome tabs and Gmail‚Äôs read and unread functionality. But, it didn‚Äôt fit the vision.

The biggest challenge was figuring out how to properly organize the information and house it cohesively in the information architecture so that users would learn by doing. The UX should show, not tell, and be self-explanatory enough to encourage browsing, letting users just tap their way to something interesting.

The UI went through a few changes.

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 1
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/carousel-1.jpeg,/images/carousel-2.jpeg,/images/carousel-3.jpeg
	"
%}


#### The first iteration

Navigating the GLOBE seemed like a top priority. But, my first iteration was hiding usability.

![](/images/V.1.png)

Upon testing with users, the biggest gripe they had was that the navigation wasn‚Äôt obvious. Also, they wondered where the content curated to the front page came from. How could that be managed, and how could you quickly choose to browse something else? At the time, all that functionality was hidden in a menu that was opened in the upper right.

![](/images/v1.5.png)
I thought refining the menu‚Äôs layout, and the filter capabilities would solve the usability issue. But, this was as far as I went in this direction.

Then, I received some severe criticism on V.1 from a fellow designer that I‚Äôll always be grateful for. She tore the app apart, dissecting it to reveal the disjointed mess that it was. I was crushed during the moments it took me to read her unmoderated test notes. I questioned myself, can I do this?

My response to this apparent defeat was rather stoic, if I say so myself. I immediately began sketching. I was determined to show that I knew what I was doing.

#### The second iteration

![](/images/v.2-sketch.jpeg)
Simple is always better.

A mentor at Springboard gave me a great piece of advice: you don‚Äôt want to ask users too many questions. I worked with this in mind.

I believe the second iteration was more more aligned with my vision of its functionality.

![](/images/V.2.png)
V.2 is far more self explanatory, and explorable than V.1. It looks and feels more like an app.

On the surface, it didn‚Äôt look too much different from other content feeds. And, that‚Äôs a good thing. UX conventions are our friend.

The wonderful thing was that the design was finally scalable. Buttons can be added, features expanded, and content can be further compartmentalized and given improved interaction design. There‚Äôs room now for more estuaries to spring forth from the rains of intuition and user feedback.

#### Conclusion

The difference between V.1 and V.2 took nearly three months. It was a waiting game, and anyone that‚Äôs played one can relate to how much it test‚Äôs their patience.

With every obstacle I faced doubt. The obvious design wasn‚Äôt so obvious at first because I was trying too hard to be entirely original. Yet, UI‚Äôs that feel familiar to users only benefit the product‚Äôs UX.

The end result was worth the struggle. It was definitely a duh! moment. I am thoroughly satisfied with the current functionality of the prototype. I believe it to be the right cornerstone to build upon.

The visual design could use some work. But, with consistent feedback I hope to achieve the aesthetic I desire ‚Äî a nod to the classic layout of a newspaper, but with a modern twist.

Or, as my girlfriend would say:

> ‚ÄúWho do you think you are, the New York Times?‚Äù

#### Lessons learned

* White space, white space, white space. I‚Äôm now firm in my belief that it‚Äôs actually difficult to have too much white space. In a news climate full of white noise, I‚Äôm sure white space is appreciated.
* Red routes are crucial to solidifying an MVP. The seemingly limitless nature of idea-building (as I call it) is by far my favorite part of UX design. But, it‚Äôs easy to make things too complicated. It‚Äôs far more difficult to create simple solutions to complex problems.
* Frustration is also an important part of the design journey. Every wall I broke through served as a lesson in humility, patience, empathy, and foundational understanding.
* Reduce, reuse, recycle. Consistency in design is absolutely crucial. Follow Picasso‚Äôs words, and eliminate the unnecessary.
* Finally, no idea is totally untouchable. I had to get down and dirty to make it happen. My design took many shapes. There were a lot of things on the drawing board that I was forced to compromise on for the moment to validate the higher level concept.

#### Going forward ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
Lucky it‚Äôs a digital product, and features that were compromised on at first can be added in later iterations to create more depth. Here are some future milestones:

1. The UI could definitely use some love. A better visual design and hierarchy. Soften the edges of media tooltips. Lesson the severity of content element outlines, and use a grey instead of a black. Also, more white space ‚Äî will there ever be enough?!
2. The onboarding process requires a subtle blend of depth and simplicity that teaches users by doing.
3. Expand the database's capabilities by creating transparent publication and journalist profiles for users to examine or follow. Pubs and journalists can be scored on some sort of metric, and their body of work will be available for perusal.
4. Provide users with more context on topics and events they are interested in by adding a function to 'view backstory,' allowing users to dig into the history of topics and events.
5. Include a separate tab that includes feature articles and opeds, all the great stories that people would like to read but are not always considered hard news.
6. Continue to flesh out the topics and events pages, and the reporting timeline. A more engaging UX can be accomplished.
7. Create a reading-mode for sources that users wish to visit within the app. Highlight citations found in articles, and timestamp videos to save users time when checking facts.
8. Politics and legislation may require its own unique UX. The goal is to update users not only with political news, but also legislative updates on bills and policy changes in the works across municipal, state, and federal levels.
9. Local news ‚Äî now this one will be interesting. It will require a renewed research focus.
